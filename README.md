Introduction to the Egg Catcher Game
Welcome to Egg Catcher, a fun and engaging Python game where your goal is to catch as many eggs as possible while avoiding bombs! This game combines quick reflexes and strategic movement to maximize your score and keep your lives intact.

Goal of the Game
Your primary objective in Egg Catcher is to score points by catching falling eggs while avoiding or catching bombs. The game becomes progressively challenging as you try to keep up with the increasing number of falling objects. Your score increases each time you catch an egg, but you lose lives for missing eggs or catching bombs.

Game Rules
Catching Eggs: Each egg you catch adds points to your score. Different colored eggs may appear, but they all have the same value.
Avoiding Bombs: Bombs fall alongside the eggs. If you catch a bomb, you lose a life instead of gaining points.
Lives: You start with a set number of lives. Losing all your lives ends the game.
Score Penalty: Missing an egg will reduce your score. So, it's crucial to catch as many eggs as possible.
How to Play
Movement: Use the left and right arrow keys to move the catcher (represented as an arc) across the bottom of the screen.
Catch the Eggs: Position the catcher to catch the falling eggs. The catcher must be positioned correctly for the egg to be considered caught.
Avoid the Bombs: Do not let the bombs fall into the catcher. Instead, focus on dodging them or catching them to avoid losing lives.
React Quickly: The game speeds up over time, so stay alert and react quickly to changes.
